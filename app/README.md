Play: The all in one music streaming application.

Play is one of the first music streaming applications of it's kind. Play searches a plethora of websites to find streamable links and present these streams to the user in a powerful manner. Users can manually pick the best streams and save them for later playback.

Play is a beta application so there are bound to be BUGS.

Play requires action bar sherlock, inscription, showcaseview, and google play services to function.
